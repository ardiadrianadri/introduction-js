/**
 * We have an app which has two types of users; the clients and the companies. Both have to have sing up in the app
 * with the name, address, email and phone but the companies can have offers, which clients can not, and the clients
 * can bid on the offers but the companies can not.
 * 
 * Implement a efficient structure of clases which represent the entities of clients and companies
